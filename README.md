### AI-Powered Collaborative Research Assistant (CRA-AI)
A web application that leverages AI to help researchers and teams collaboratively gather, synthesize, and visualize information from disparate sources in real-time.

## üöÄ Overview
**AI-Powered Collaborative Research Assistant** streamlines the research process for academic teams, business analysts, and content creators by automating information gathering, summarization, and visualization. The platform enables real-time collaboration, allowing users to ingest documents, extract key insights with AI, and interactively explore knowledge graphs‚Äîall in one place.

## üåü Key Features
- **Real-Time Collaborative Editing & Annotation**
  + Simultaneous document editing, highlighting, and commenting (Google Docs-style)
  + Robust WebSocket handling with conflict resolution (Operational Transformation/CRDTs)
- **AI-Powered Information Extraction & Summarization**
  + Automated content ingestion (PDF, DOCX, URLs)
  + LLM-based summarization (GPT-4 via OpenAI API)
  + Entity extraction (people, organizations, dates)
  + Sentiment analysis on extracted snippets
- **Interactive Knowledge Graph & Data Visualization**
  + Dynamic knowledge graph generation (D3.js)
  + Visual exploration of entities, topics, and sources
  + Filtering and search capabilities
- **Multi-Step AI Research Workflows**
  + Define complex research queries (e.g., "Summarize economic impact of 2023 EU climate policies")
  + Automated multi-stage pipeline: data fetching, parsing, summarization, cross-referencing, synthesis
 
## üìö Documentation Structure and Maintenance
To ensure clear, traceable, and always up-to-date documentation, we use the following GitHub features and structures:
1. **README.md**
   + Entry point for all users and contributors
   + Contains project description, setup instructions, usage notes, and contribution guidelines
   + Is regularly updated, e.g., after each sprint or release
2. **docs/ Directory**
   + Contains detailed technical documents, such as:
     - architecture.md ‚Äì System architecture and design decisions
     - api_reference.md ‚Äì API documentation and endpoints
   + Ideal for developers who need deeper insights
3. **Issues and Pull Requests**
   + We use Issues for:
     - Task distribution
     - Bug tracking
     - Discussion of important decisions
   + Pull Requests are used for:
     - Quality assurance of code and documentation changes
     - Traceability of changes through reviews
4. **Branches**
   + Changes to the documentation are made in dedicated branches
   + After review and approval, they are merged into the main branch
   + Naming of the Branches:
     - [Username]-dev-[index] for development
     - [Username]-docu-[index] for documentation
